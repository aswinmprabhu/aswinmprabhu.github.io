![Lonely Room](/images/lonely-room.jpg)


In that forlorn room I sit,  
darkness and solitude reverberating  
within it's four gloomy incessant walls,  
interrupted only by a single door  
and dotted with occasional windows,  
for passers-by to peek in  
and shine their narrow light  
They come and go, taking away their  
fleeting gift of benign light  
and momentary company  
that lasted long enough for them  
to ask, to seek, to share, to tell, or to  
achieve whatever they hoped for  
Nothing more, nothing less  
They never bother to sneak in  
through the windows  
They never bother to open  
the rusty door,  
to switch on the light  
that will smear the room  
with lasting lively colors  
that'll end my lonely horrors  
But they never bother  
So in that forlorn room I sit  
never daring to venture out,  
waiting for that one true friend  
to open the door, hold my hands,  
and guide me out
