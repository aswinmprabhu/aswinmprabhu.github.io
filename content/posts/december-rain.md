![Puddle](/images/puddle.jpg)

Let all human sorrow melt away  
in this December rain.  
The rain that hides our tears,  
the rain that wipes our pain.  

Pause for a moment and look  
at yourself in the rainy puddle.  
Reflect, repent, rejoice. But move on  
when a drop falls, creates a muddle.  

When clock strikes twelve  
and rain greets the new year,  
hold close and don't let go  
of everyone you deem dear.
